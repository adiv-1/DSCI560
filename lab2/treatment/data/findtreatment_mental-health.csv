What To Expect,,,li,Understanding Mental Health
What To Expect,,,p,"Like addiction, mental health disorders are treatable medical conditions, not someone's fault. About half of people with a substance use disorder also experience serious mental illness."
What To Expect,,,p,"Almost 1 in 5 adults in the USA will experience some form of mental health disorder, and 1 in every 22 is living with a serious mental illness , like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive episodes.

What To Expect,,,p,"Many people don't seek treatment for mental health disorders or don't know their symptoms could be connected to a mental health condition. There's no easy test to tell if actions or thoughts are typical for a person, symptoms of a physical illness, or signs of a mental health disorder."
What To Expect,,,p,"Each illness has its own symptoms, but common signs of mental health disorders in adults and adolescents can include the following:"
