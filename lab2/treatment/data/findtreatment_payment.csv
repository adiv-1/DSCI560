What To Expect,,,p,"Understanding the costs of and how to pay for treatment can be hard and confusing. Unfortunately, resources aren't always well organized or easy to find. The best way to make sure you choose care that you can afford is by asking questions, taking notes, and making sure you know what kind of support you're eligible for."
What To Expect,,,p,"Don't let money stop you from finding treatment. There are free and low-cost facilities across the country, and many others accept Medicaid or private insurance. Your state also has funding set aside to help people without insurance afford treatment."
What To Expect,,,p,"The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) of 2008 requires health insurers and group health plans to provide the same level of benefits for mental and/or substance use treatment and services that they do for medical and surgical care. That means your insurance company can't tell you ""we don't do substance use treatment"" or ""mental health isn't covered."" If they do this, they're breaking the law."
What To Expect,,,p,"If you've been denied coverage for treatment, this Mental Health and Addiction Insurance Help tool can help you find the right resources to solve issues with your insurance."
What To Expect,,,p,Call the number on the back of your card or on your insurer's website and ask about coverage for substance use.
What To Expect,,,p,"You'll likely have a deductible , a specific amount of money you'll need to pay out-of-pocket before your benefits start covering costs. Find out how much that deductible is and how much you've already paid towards it for the year. Any medical expense, not just treatment, can count towards that total."
What To Expect,,,p,"Then, ask your insurer for a list of preferred facilities or providers in your area. Choosing from this list will help prevent unexpected costs down the line, because your insurance will be more willing to cover the services you receive."
What To Expect,,,p,"Just as with other kinds of medical care, you may have a co-pay , a small amount of money you need to pay upfront to the providers or facilities you visit. Find out how much that is, as well as how many appointments or days of treatment are covered per year."
What To Expect,,,p,"You can also ask your insurer if they have case managers . A case manager is a registered nurse, social worker, or other licensed healthcare provider who can work with you directly. Their services are usually covered by the cost you're already paying to your insurance. They'll help you evaluate your options and choose what makes the most medical and financial sense."
What To Expect,,,p,"It can take multiple calls to figure this information out, and these can be difficult conversations to have. If you have a trusted family member or friend who can help, there is a way your insurer can authorize them to make decisions on your behalf. Ask your insurer for more details about how to set this up."
What To Expect,,,p,"Some facilities offer free or low-cost care, sliding scale fees based on your income, or have payment assistance available."
What To Expect,,,p,"You'll need an estimate of your annual income and a correct count of your family members to determine if you're eligible for some services. You don't have to know exactly how much you make, just get as close as you can, and don't worry if it's not perfect (See what counts as income on healthcare.gov )."
What To Expect,,,p,"Additionally, every state has funding to provide treatment for people without insurance. Contact your state agency for information on how the process works in your state."
What To Expect,,,p,You may also be able to purchase insurance now and take advantage of those benefits. Visit healthcare.gov for more information.
What To Expect,,,p,"Some individual treatment facilities offer grants or scholarships to help offset the cost of attending. Not all of these will cover your whole stay, though, and many will revoke funding if you don't complete their program, leaving you financially responsible for the time you spent there. Before accepting any grants or scholarships, make sure you ask questions about what (if any) strings are attached to that money."
