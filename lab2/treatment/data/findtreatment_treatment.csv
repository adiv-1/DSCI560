What To Expect,,,li,Understanding Mental Health
What To Expect,,,p,"Treatment helps people disrupt addiction's powerful effects on the brain and behavior, and regain control of their lives. There are many kinds of treatment; your recovery may include one or more of these."
What To Expect,,,p,A process that helps the body rid itself of substances while the symptoms of withdrawal are treated. Detoxification by itself is not treatment; it is a first step that can prepare a person for treatment. More details about pre-treatment and detox .
What To Expect,,,p,"Many facilities have long waitlists, but can still help. Interim care provides daily medication and emergency counseling. This can be a helpful bridge from beginning recovery to admission to a regular outpatient, inpatient, or residential setting."
What To Expect,,,p,"Outpatient treatment is best for people willing to attend regular appointments and counseling sessions. Since there is no overnight care, its important to have a stable living environment, reliable transportation, and supportive family or friends."
What To Expect,,,p,"Care frequency depends on the program, with some requiring daily attendance and others meeting one to three times per week. Outpatient care usually lasts from about two months to one year."
What To Expect,,,p,"These are usually connected to a hospital or clinic, and provide detox and rehabilitative care. People with serious mental or medical concerns, as well as substance use disorders, are the most likely to use inpatient treatment."
What To Expect,,,p,Teens and adolescents benefit from the structure of inpatient treatment to fully understand their needs and make a treatment plan.
What To Expect,,,p,A stable setting for long-term phased treatment. Each facility has specific rules and expectations for both residents and their families. Residential care usually lasts from a few months to a year.
What To Expect,,,p,"Theyre best for people without stable living or work situations, and/or who have limited or no family support in treatment. They also help people with very serious disorders who have been unable to get and stay sober or drug free in other treatment."
What To Expect,,,p,"As part of the path to independent living, these facilities support people in recovery with temporary places to live. They may also have support programs around employment and education, or case managers to help residents succeed during and after their stay."
What To Expect,,,p,"Having both a substance use and mental health disorder is called a co-occurring disorder. About half of people who experience one will also experience the other . Addressing both is critical for success in recovery, and integrated treatment programs can help."
What To Expect,,,p,"Integrated care brings together different areas of expertise to treat the whole person, and ensure that treatment for one factor doesnt interfere with treatment of others."
What To Expect,,,p,"Telemedicine can be a tremendous help to people who are unable to regularly get to a treatment facility. While its not the first step in treatment, telemedicine can be a key part of a treatment plan, especially for patients living far away from a facility."
What To Expect,,,p,"Although no single recovery pathway is right for everyone, people who are addicted to opioids are usually more successful with medication-assisted treatment (MAT). This treatment uses FDA-approved medication together with counseling and behavioral therapies."
What To Expect,,,p,"Three FDA-approved medications are used in the U.S. to treat opioid addiction: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone."
What To Expect,,,p,"Methadone is a long-acting medication that reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It can block the euphoric effects of short-acting opioids, such as heroin."
What To Expect,,,p,"Methadone is usually taken daily as a drinkable liquid. It can be dispensed only at licensed, federally-regulated opioid treatment programs, so having reliable daily transportation to a clinic is important while taking methadone."
What To Expect,,,p,"Because methadone controls withdrawal symptoms and blocks cravings, people who are addicted to opioids tend to stick with it. This allows them to build a life in recovery and avoid the hazards and problems that come with illegal drug use. People who take methadone for a year or more have the best rates of success."
What To Expect,,,p,Methadone can work for people who have made other unsuccessful attempts to stop using opioids. It is a recommended treatment for opioid use disorder during pregnancy.
What To Expect,,,p,"Buprenorphine works in a similar way to methadone, controlling withdrawal symptoms and blocking cravings. Buprenorphine is usually taken daily as a small film that must be dissolved under the tongue."
What To Expect,,,p,"Most guidelines suggest people with shorter, less extensive histories of heavy opioid use may be good candidates for treatment with buprenorphine. It also works for more severe opioid use disorder and for people who decide to switch from methadone."
What To Expect,,,p,"Buprenorphine can be a good choice for people who cant regularly get to an opioid treatment program. Doctors who have completed a required training and certification process can prescribe buprenorphine for patients they see in the office. While the beginning of treatment usually involves frequent in-office visits, patients may be able to have a prescription to take at home."
What To Expect,,,p,"Buprenorphine is widely available in a formula that contains added naloxone (commonly known as Narcan), which discourages abusing or injecting it."
What To Expect,,,p,"Naltrexone blocks the ability of opioids to eliminate pain and induce euphoria. This removes the rewarding aspects of opioid use that result in a desire for more. It is available in either an extended-release injection that is given every 30 days, or in tablet form that is taken once a day by mouth."
What To Expect,,,p,"Because of the way naltrexone blocks opioid receptors in the brain, its not a good fit for everyone. Before starting naltrexone, you need to get through an initial 7-10 days of withdrawal. People with chronic pain problems, who sometimes need to take opioid medications, should work carefully with their doctor about a pain management strategy before starting naltrexone."
What To Expect,,,p,Naltrexone works well for highly motivated people who are able to stop opioid use for 7-10 days prior to beginning treatment. It is a good option for those who are eager to eliminate all opioids. The injectable form is helpful for people who have a hard time keeping up with daily pills.
What To Expect,,,p,"Since it is approved for treating alcohol problems as well, people taking naltrexone may find it also helps them avoid drinking."
What To Expect,,,p,"When you call, facility staff will ask questions about yourself. You can ask questions too. It's important to make sure the services and facility are a good fit for you."
What To Expect,,,p,"This is a confidential call . Answering the questions honestly is important, and you won't be reported to law enforcement for talking about using illegal drugs."
What To Expect,,,p,"If a facility can't see you within 48 hours, try another one. A sign of quality care is being able to be seen quickly. Many programs offer walk-in care, or interim care if only a waitlist is available."
What To Expect,,,li,If you're calling for yourself or someone else.
What To Expect,,,li,"Which drugs or alcohol have you been using, for how long, and how much."
What To Expect,,,li,"Current health conditions and medications, including pain medications you're currently taking."
What To Expect,,,li,"What financial resources are you working with (insurance, money from a loved one, etc.?)"
What To Expect,,,li,When can I get an appointment?
What To Expect,,,li,How much will treatment cost? Do you accept my insurance?
What To Expect,,,li,What do I need to bring? What should I not bring?
What To Expect,,,li,How do I get to the facility? Is there public transportation? Can you pick me up?
What To Expect,,,li,"Consider asking questions that are important for you and your situation: Is the facility smoke-free or is smoking allowed? Are there childcare options available? What types of medications am I allowed to take while in treatment? What kind of family contact is allowed, and when?"
What To Expect,,,li,Is the facility smoke-free or is smoking allowed?
What To Expect,,,li,Are there childcare options available?
What To Expect,,,li,What types of medications am I allowed to take while in treatment?
What To Expect,,,li,"What kind of family contact is allowed, and when?"
What To Expect,,,p,"Everyone entering treatment receives a clinical assessment to determine the type of treatment that's the best fit. No one type of treatment is right for everyone; to work, the treatment needs to meet your individual needs."
What To Expect,,,p,"Although clinical assessment continues throughout a person's treatment, it starts at or just before a person's admission to a treatment program. All facilities in FindTreatment.gov offer assessment services."
What To Expect,,,p,"Medically supervised withdrawal (often called detoxification or detox) uses medication to help people withdraw from alcohol or drugs after using large amounts. Sometimes, withdrawal can be so severe that people hallucinate, have convulsions, or develop other dangerous conditions."
What To Expect,,,p,"Detox can take place on a regular medical ward of a hospital, in a specialized inpatient detoxification unit, or on an outpatient basis with close medical supervision. Detoxification may take several days to a week or more."
What To Expect,,,p,Social detoxification can provide the support and care for someone who doesn't need to be medically supervised during withdrawal. Sometimes social detoxification centers are part of a residential treatment program; other times they are separate facilities.
What To Expect,,,p,"Social detoxification centers are not hospitals and seldom use medication, but the person does stay there from several days to one week. A staff of nurses watches each person's medical condition closely, and counselors are available to help them through the most difficult parts of withdrawing from alcohol and drugs."
What To Expect,,,p,It is important to know that detoxification is not treatment ; it is a first step that can prepare a person for treatment.
What To Expect,,,p,"In most treatment programs, the main caregivers are specially trained individuals who are certified or licensed as substance use treatment counselors ."
What To Expect,,,p,"Most treatment programs assign patients to a treatment team of professionals. Depending on the type of treatment, teams can be made up of social workers, counselors, doctors, nurses, psychologists, and psychiatrists."
What To Expect,,,p,"Be honest during the assessment; the counselor needs to get a full picture of the problem to plan and help implement the most effective treatment. You may feel embarrassed answering some of these questions or have difficulty completing the interview, but remember: the counselor is there to help."
What To Expect,,,p,"After the assessment, the counselor will work with you (and possibly your family members) to develop a treatment plan . This plan lists problems, treatment goals, and ways to meet those goals."
What To Expect,,,li,Licensed and accredited . All facilities in FindTreatment.gov are licensed by the state they're in.
What To Expect,,,li,Medication . A facility should only use FDA-approved medication in treating alcohol or opioid use. There are no FDA-approved medications to help prevent relapse from other problem substances.
What To Expect,,,li,"Evidence-based practices . Quality programs should offer a full range of services that are accepted as effective in treatment and recovery, including: Motivational therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) Drug and alcohol counseling and education Peer support Care for or help accessing care for other physical and mental health needs."

What To Expect,,,li,Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
What To Expect,,,li,Drug and alcohol counseling and education
What To Expect,,,li,Peer support
What To Expect,,,li,Care for or help accessing care for other physical and mental health needs.
What To Expect,,,li,Families . Family Members should be included in the treatment process. They have an important role in understanding the impact of addiction and being supportive in recovery.
What To Expect,,,li,"Support beyond substance use . For many, addiction is a chronic disease that needs ongoing support. A quality program treats the whole patient for the long term. This can include ongoing counseling or recovery coaching, and help meeting basic needs like sober housing, employment support, and continued family involvement."
