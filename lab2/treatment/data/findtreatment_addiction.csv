What To Expect,,,li,Understanding Mental Health
What To Expect,,,p,"People from all backgrounds experience addiction. Addiction doesn't care how old you are, how much money you make, or the color of your skin; it has no bias. While the initial choice to use a drug is often voluntary, the powerful effects of addiction makes it very hard to stop, even if someone wants to."
What To Expect,,,p,"When drugs or alcohol are used so often that they have significant negative effects on your life, making it unlivable to the quality it was before, this is called a substance use disorder ."
What To Expect,,,p,"It causes intense cravings for alcohol or drugs, and can include:"
What To Expect,,,li,"Using illegal drugs like heroin or cocaine, or excessive alcohol drinking."
What To Expect,,,li,"Using prescription drugs in ways other than prescribed, or using someone else's prescription."
What To Expect,,,p,"Addiction is a chronic and treatable disease. Using drugs repeatedly changes the brain, including the parts that help exert self-control. That's why someone may not be able to stop using drugs, even if they know the drug is causing harm, or feel ready to stop."
What To Expect,,,p,Some common behaviors of addiction and substance use disorder include:
What To Expect,,,li,"Trying to stop or cut down on drug use, but not being able to."
What To Expect,,,li,Using drugs because of being angry or upset with other people.
What To Expect,,,li,Taking one drug to get over the effects of another.
What To Expect,,,li,Making mistakes at school or on the job because of using drugs.
What To Expect,,,li,Drug use hurting relationships with family and friends.
What To Expect,,,li,Being scared at the thought of running out of drugs.
What To Expect,,,li,Stealing drugs or money to pay for drugs.
What To Expect,,,li,Being arrested or hospitalized for drug use.
What To Expect,,,li,"Developing a tolerance, and needing larger amounts of drugs or alcohol to get high."
What To Expect,,,li,Overdosing on drugs.
What To Expect,,,p,"It takes courage to seek help for a drug problem. But remember: treatment works, there are many paths to help, and people recover every day."
What To Expect,,,p,"Like other chronic diseases, addiction can be managed successfully. It can take several attempts at treatment to find the right approach. Treatment helps people disrupt addiction's powerful effects on the brain and behavior and regain control of their lives."
What To Expect,,,p,"FindTreatment.gov lists facilities across the country. We have guidance about what to expect when looking for treatment, including different kinds of treatment and understanding how to pay for treatment ."
What To Expect,,,p,"Many treatment professionals consider substance use disorders to be family diseases. To help everyone recover and cope, family may be asked to take part in treatment. This may involve going to a family education program or to counseling for families or couples."
What To Expect,,,p,"As you and your family member recover, remember:"
What To Expect,,,li,"You are participating in treatment for yourself, not just for the sake of the person who used substances."
What To Expect,,,li,"Your loved ones recovery, sobriety, or abstinence does not depend on you."
What To Expect,,,li,Your familys recovery does not depend on the recovery of the person who used substances.
What To Expect,,,li,You did not cause your family members substance use disorder. It is not your fault.
What To Expect,,,p,"You still may have hurt feelings and anger from the past that need to be resolved. You need support to understand and deal with these feelings, and you need to support your loved ones efforts to get well."
What To Expect,,,p,"If you think your family member or friend might be addicted, you cannot fix the problem by yourself, or force them into treatment. If the person is initially not willing to be helped, learn more about drug addiction for your own knowledge, and see if there are resources or information that might convince them to seek help."
What To Expect,,,p,"Everyone acts differently when they start treatment. Some people are very happy to be getting treatment at last; others suffer a great deal while they adjust to a new life and attempt to live it without alcohol and drugs. They may be sad, angry, or confused. It is important for you to realize that these are normal reactions and to get support for yourself."
